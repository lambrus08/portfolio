            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Hello my Name is Aldo Lambruschini, I have 10 years of Real Estate Sales Experience. It ranges from the
                Financial side, all the way to completing Real Estate transactions. For the last 6 years I've worked
                at Cox Communications as a Field Technician in Video, Internet and Phone. This has sparked my interest
                from when I was a teenager to do what I love, which is anything technology. I've always been fascinated
                with applications and programs and look forward to applying my influence in this huge spectrum.
            </p>

            <p>I had a moment of realization recently to just do what makes me happy and to follow my passions. This is
                a
                subject that I've been interested in. So I finally decided to do something about it and
                not let this opportunity pass by. I am taking this class because it will give all the fundamentals and
                skills necessary to become a successful web developer.
            </p>

                Ultimately I want to work for a video game company or produce some kind of mobile game. As of today I am
                still learning what field really interests me and I'm sure I will be able to narrow it down as I
                complete
                this course.</p>
