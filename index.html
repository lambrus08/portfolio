    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hello my Name is Aldo Lambruschini, I have 10 years of Real Estate Sales Experience. It ranges from the
        Financial side, all the way to completing Real Estate transactions. For the last 6 years I've worked
        at Cox Communications as a Field Technician in Video, Internet and Phone. This has sparked my interest
        from when I was a teenager to do what I love, which is anything technology. I've always been fascinated
        with applications and programs and look forward to applying my influence in this huge spectrum.
    </p>

    <p>I had a moment of realization recently to just do what makes me happy and to follow my passions. This is a
        subject that I've been interested in. So I finally decided to do something about it and
        not let this opportunity pass by. I am taking this class because it will give all the fundamentals and
        skills necessary to become a successful web developer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ultimately I want to work for a video game company or produce some kind of mobile game. As of today I am
        still learning what field really interests me and I'm sure I will be able to narrow it down as I complete
        this course.</p>
